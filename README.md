James J. Clark has graciously made his book, *Advanced Programming Techniques for Modular Synthesizers*, [available on his website for many years](https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~clark/nordmodularbook/nm_book_toc.html).

This repository contains a conversion of the website book to Markdown and then to PDF using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

Since GitHub natively renders Markdown, you can [read the book online in your web browser](all.md) or you can [download the respository to read offline](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6466993).
