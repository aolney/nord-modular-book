A 35 oscillator patch. Uses 25% of the dsp which yields
16 voices, for a total of 560 oscillators.
JJClark (c) 1999
___________________________________________________________________
On AH people were asking about the maximum number of oscillators you can get on
the Nord Modular, so I propose a challenge:
a) what is the largest number of oscillators in a single patch
b) what is the largest number of oscillators in an unexpanded NM
To get things rolling, I submit two patches. One uses lfo's and gets 35 oscillators but
only uses 25% dsp so you can get 16x35=560 oscillators total (although I only get 8
voices for some reason).
You might think lfos are cheating, so the second patch uses the sinebank oscillators
and gets 33 oscillators but uses up 98% dsp. So one only gets 4 voices and 132
oscillators total.
Can anyone beat this?
(I am also including a patch which uses logic elements to make oscillators
just to remind you to think sideways once in a while).

well jj..my modular comes in a few days...so i will give it a shot...
BUT...just for the record...I AM NOT buying this for polyphony...i would much rather
have 100 lfos and 1 audio oscillator...than the other way around
i look at this like a trombone, my first instrument, where you play each single note with
MAXIMUM expression...
i'll take that anyday over 128 stale samples, simultaneously pissing their way thru a
crappy orchestration.

This might be a stupid question, since you have a nord and (until tomorrow, according
to reuse it) I don't.. but isn't this a moot point? I seem to remember this conversation on
AH long before the nord came out.. something about, after 4-6 oscillators you didn't
really hear much of a difference... something about phase cancellations (although, I
don't see why the phase alignments would have to be off.. maybe this was a
particularly analogue thing).. ohh well..
I agree with mr marko.. I'd rather have 1 osc and 100 LFOs than vica versa, but I'd
also like to see more patch points as well ;)..

#3 is the issue I was talking about.. after too many osc get stacked, you get phase
cancellations..

actually, my nord is staying on the bookshelf until i hand in my thesis. ;)
I suppose it is partly a question of what model you have in mind, oscillator-wise. If i am
doing straightup additive synthesis, i'd like nothing better than around ten kazillion
oscillators.  er.. all sinusoidal, and possibly fixed frequency, though not necessarily.
lots of early computer music systems used the numberof oscillators available for
additive synthesis as a benchmark of their powerfulness.  some still do, i guess.
er.. ok.  cheers, yon

This thread has prompted me to wade deep into the jungles of the AH archive (on
marks site) to locate this thread I can barely remember (mainly to re educate myself on
multiple osc usage.. it never was much of a priority in the past)..
Here are two bits that pertain to what we are talking about... for all I know, this
information could be wrong, but I trust the sources..
----------
More can be better, if you're going after sonic complexity. To reiterate a post by Marc
Paping, when detuning more than one osc, have the detuned osc be quieter than the
original so the fundamental doesn't cancel entirely. The strength of multiple oscs is to
either create interval stacks or to create a single sound with multiple harmonic
aspects, such as having two or more sync'd oscs set to different harmonics, etc. Poly
instruments with a unison mode are a great example of what you'd expect from multiple
oscs. You get a huge, rich sound.
That's what more means!" - Robbie Sinclair, Jim Henson's "Dinosaurs"
On the other hand, multiple oscs, when detuned, which is probable when using
analog technology, will generate beat frequencies that cancel and reinforce the
waveform. Using a single oscillator on bass sounds is a good thing, as it allows total
stability in the sound's volume. You can create a more complex sound by mixing all the
waveforms together from that single oscillator, since they are all in phase. Oscillators
with phase locking (Moog 921b, etc.) allow multiple oscs to lock together in perfect
phase, thus creating a rich sound without beat cancellation. Or, sync'ing a second
osc, tuning it a bit higher in pitch, and not sweeping it can add size without
cancellation.

There is a point of diminishing returns with more oscillators. Each one you add makes
a smaller difference than the last. I usually only 2-3 is usually good, and less often 4.
One reason to use 3-4 is for fatter sounds in multiple octaves (maybe 1 at 32", 2 at
16', 1 at 8'). Another is to have different treatments on each: Example: (this doesn't
sound anything like a TB-303) One at "center" pitch Second slightly detuned.
Third modulated by EG to slide up into unison Fourth with slight pitch modulation from
LFO or S/H.
Another reason to have more is for use as modulation sources. VCO to VCO FM, VCO
to VCF Cutoff FM, as LFO, etc.
I sometimes use many oscillators (10-20) in unison for fun but the sound is not
necessarily any fatter than 2-3, and often it is not as fat as 2-3. With more than 3
oscillators there is more potential for phase cancellation. So having many oscillators
often gives an effect similar to a flanger or phaser, although it is different, maybe more
subtle.
There are so many possibilities that others might find other ways to use many
oscillators. It never hurts to have the option. But 4 is enough for most applications and
for many great sounds you only need 1, 2, or 3.
Regards,
Mike.

Seems in a *real* analogue, each oscillator would have it's own characteristics, like
1. kbd tracking variations and non-linearities
2. stability variations over time
3. waveform asymmetry variations
4. q variations in amplitude that would make the oscillators sound "phat".
When the 44 module limit is lifted, seems you could "build in" these variations through
different techniques to get that same "analogue sound"? 1, 2, and 4 seem like they
could be implemented. 3 seems like it couldn't, because the waveforms are
computed?
Also, it seems like it would be nice if you could TELL the NM where you want your
poles and zeros on the filters...this would enable huge variation in filter types for those
engineering types. (A macro type filter that would let people "download" the
coefficients?) (Since I've never done DSP filters, am I out to lunch here?)
